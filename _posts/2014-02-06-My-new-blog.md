title: My new blog
---

So I thought I'd try again at this blogging lark. I expect the novelty to wear off within a few weeks and this content will then languish here ignored, but for now I've got to at least start with good intentions.

In an effort to keep my interest going a little longer than last time I thought I'd try out something a bit different to the LAMP stack I've been ignoring for the last few years.

I'm hosting on Windows Azure (I knew the free MSDN credits would come in useful for something) and running Ghost. It was a doddle to set up, the Ghost team have added a single click installer to the Azure gallery.

And now, that's enought of the standard first post waffle, I better get on with trying some real content.
