title: I’ve quit my job
---

So today after 11 years of working at [Mediaburst](https://www.mediaburst.co.uk) I handed in my notice. 
It’s been a great place to work - that's why I’ve been there so long - but since they were taken over a year
ago things just haven’t been the same. 

So around October last year I started thinking about what should come next and stumbled accross 
an <abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3oc4cz/i_just_hiked_the_2189_mile_appalachian_trail_from/)
by a guy who’d just finished walking the full length of [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail)
in America. My initial thought was something along the lines of 
“How the hell does anyone find a spare 6 months just to go for a walk?” and I thought nothing much more of it at the time. 

However at the back of my mind the thought kept popping up of how interesting it sounded to go on a stupidly long walk. And, 
to cut a long story short, by early November I’d somehow convinced myself that I wanted to go on a 2,200 (ish) mile walk.

So in early December I headed off to London to ask the US Embassy very nicely if they’d give me a B2 (tourist) Visa - 
and they did :)

In mid March I’ll be jumping on a plane to Atlanta, Georgia, for day 1 of 6 or 7 months walking.




So here’s a few of the questions I’ve been asked so far...

## What’s the Appalachian Trail?

Given that most people have never heard of it this seems a good place to start. 
The Appalachian Trail is a national scenic trail in the USA. It's a touch under 2,200 miles long and runs from a 
car park just north of Atlanta in Georgia, to a mountain in the middle of nowhere in Maine 
(I looked on a map and didn’t recognise anywhere nearby).

## What’s a thru-hike?

Thru-hiking is where you start at one end of the tail and carry on until you reach the other end. It doesn’t matter
which end you start at - although I’m going to follow the trend and head north.

## Why?

I don’t really know how to answer this one. After 11 years in the same job I fancy something new and sheer laziness 
has meant I’m not a homeowner yet so this seems like a good time. Quite how that something ended up being a 
2000+ mile walk is beyond me.
