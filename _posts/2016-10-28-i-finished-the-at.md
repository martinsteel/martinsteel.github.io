title: I finished the Appalachian Trail!

If you’ve read any of my blog posts in the last year you’ll know I planned to hike all 2,189 miles of the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. If you read my last post you’ll even know I made it about a third of the way before going silent. Well I’m happy to say that at about lunchtime on 29th September 2016 I reached Katahdin’s summit.

My original intention had been to put up a new blog post about once a week along the whole journey. However, as I progressed along the trail, publishing the posts and uploading photos became more and more of a chore. That last post took 4 or 5 hours to publish, only about 1 of those hours was spent writing, the rest of the time was spent fighting the rubbish hotel wifi. Given that I typically only stopped for between half a day to a whole day in town I decided I didn’t want to waste my time fighting technology so gave up blogging and stuck with just posting on twitter *(in hindsight I really should’ve posted this paragraph back then)*.  

If you'd like to see how I progressed along the trail take a look at the [map](/map/), you can hover over points to see the dates.

## What now?    

That’s a great question, and the honest answer at this moment is I’m not completely sure. Since finishing I’ve been dinghy sailing in Greece with friends and visited family up in Scotland, I surpose it’s now time to do something sensible and stop spending my savings.
