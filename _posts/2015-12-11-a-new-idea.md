So [back in March](/blog/2015/ive-had-an-idea/) I posted about how I'd had an idea, 
I then forgot about it and didn't post anything else. That idea, unfortunately, didn't go anywhere :( 

I'd applied to [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) 
to work as a wintering communications manager - that would've been around 18 months on an Antarctic research station
as a radio operator and general I.T. dogsbody. Unluckily for me there were a couple of guys with more relevant experience than
me in the final interview round and they're now busy freezing at the South Pole instead.

So moving on to a more positive note, and the new idea mentioned in my title: 
I'm off for a walk (quite a long one). Futher details to follow.
