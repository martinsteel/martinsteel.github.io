title: Now powered by Jekyll
---

For my first attempt at blogging I went with the industry heavyweight: WordPress. In general I'd sum it up as annoying. Whilst it's amazingly powerful and flexible the editor has a nasty habit of mangling content and theming it involves PHP, it also involves faffing around with various plugins if you want decent performance.

Next I gave [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) a try, I really like the admin UI, writing posts in Markdown is great and the default theme is lovely, however I went with the self hosted option and keeping it up to date on Azure was more hassle than it was worth. I might give Ghost another try once it hits version 1.

Which brought me on to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). They're powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), support Markdown and HTML and best of all there's nothing to keep up to date.

As you can see I haven't yet rolled out a super exciting design, for now I'm using a tweaked version of [Poole](http://getpoole.com) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

Lets see how long it lasts this time.
