title: The journey to Antarctica - Part 2

[Part 1 is here](/blog/2017/journey-to-antarctica-part-1).

Luckily the flight down to Novo went ahead as planned on Sunday morning and I arrived at Novo 6 hours later. The upgrade to the 757 was even better than expected, the plane ALCI ended up chartering was fitted out to full on VIP spec with super comfy leather seat and ooodles of leg room.

Arriving at Novo the luxury ended but that didn't matter, we were all too excited to be in Antarctica. Getting off the plane, the Novo staff helped us off the stairs to make sure we didn't slip on the highly polished blue ice runway.

12 lucky people were whisked straight off to a waiting Bassler DC3 to continue on to Halley. I was left there with 17 others pointed and in the direct on a couple of porta-cabins next to the runway. We spent a couple of nights waiting at Novo - that was plenty - the highlight being the BAS vs Russia & Argentina football match. Watching people play football in giant Baffin boots is hilarious.

Tuesday morning while at breakfast we were told our flight to Halley would be leaving in 30 minutes, and 25 minutes later (surely the first flight ever to leaver early) we were in the air flying in a Bassler DC3 on the way to Halley.

Arriving at Halley was amazing, as the plane came in to land the famous string of modules came in to view and once landed we were greeted by Al, the Halley Station Leader, and welcomed to Antarctica before heading off to the station in a Snow-Cat for a late morning Smoko - an an extra mid-morning meal between Breakfast and Lunch (we have 5 meals a day down here). Then the induction could begin.

## Halley Induction

Antarctica being a cold, hostile place, everyone has to go through an induction when they first arrive on station. Some of this is really obvious stuff like a tour of the modules and where you'll be sleeping, other parts are about how to stay safe.

* Polar clothing and cold weather safety
* Outside tour
