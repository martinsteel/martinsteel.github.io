title: And now it’s real
---

So my Appalachian Trail hike finally feels real, up until now it had just felt like an idea but now with 
everything on my todo list ticked, it’s actually going to happen.

Last Friday was my last day of work for a good 6 months, tomorrow I hand back the keys to my flat and then
bright and early Wednesday morning I’m off to Atlanta. I’ve then given myself a day for last minute panicking - 
especially if I find my tent and backpack aren’t waiting at the post office as agreed - before heading up the 
AT Approach Trail up Springer Mountain on Friday. 

In preparation of the many posts with pictures of trees and maybe even a bear, I’ve tweaked my site design. The blog is now 
front and centre and there’s a new [hike map](/map/) menu item where you can see my progress along the trail 
(or an exciting trip to Stretford if you check it before I’ve cleared the test data).
