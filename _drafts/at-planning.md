Title: A.T. Planning
---

So, It turns out Iâ€™m not the most organised person when planning a long trip. 
With 5 weeks to go there are still a few major things missing from my gear list.

## Stuff to get:

- Travel insurance
- Sleeping bag *might be a little chilly at -7 without one*.
- Sleeping mat 
- A coat
- Clothes
- Lots of little things like first aid supplies.

## Things I have managed:

- A tent (to collect in Atlanta)
- Backpack (also to collect in Atlanta)
- Shoes
- Hiking Poles
- Some clothes
