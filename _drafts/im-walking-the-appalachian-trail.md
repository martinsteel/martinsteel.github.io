title: I’m walking the Appalachian Trail
---

So a couple of months back I read an AMA on Reddit by a random bloke talking about how he’d walked the Appalachian Trail.
It all sounded quite interesting but my initial thought was something along the lines of 
"How the hell does anyone find a spare 6 months just to go for a walk?" and I thought nothing much more of it. 

However at the back of my mind the thought kept popping up of how interesting it sounded to go on a stupidly long walk. And, 
to cut a long story short, a few weeks later I'd somehow convinced myself that I wanted to go on a 2,200 (ish) mile walk
thru-hiking the [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail).

So here’s a few of the questions I’ve been asked so far...

## What’s the Appalachian Trail?

Given that most people have never heard of it this seems a good place to start. 
The Appalachian Trail is a national scenic trail in the USA. It's a touch under 2,200 miles long and runs from a 
car park just north of Atlanta in Georgia, to a mountain in the middle of knowhere in Maine 
(I looked on a map and didn’t recognise anywhere nearby).

## What’s a thru-hike?

Thru-hiking is where you start at one end of the tail and don’t stop until you reach the other end. It doesn’t matter
which end you start at - although I’m going to follow the trend and head north.

## Why?

I don’t really know how to answer this one. After 11 years in the same job I fancy something new and sheer laziness 
has meant I’m not a homeowner yet so this seems like a good time.
