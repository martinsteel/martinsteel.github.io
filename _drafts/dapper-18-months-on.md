title: Dapper: 18 months on
---

So originally, I was going to write a blog post about how [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) was amazingly fast and simple to get going. It still is, but after using it in production for over 18 months it feels a bit late to write that post. Instead I'm going to waffle about my favourite features and why you should all be using it.
