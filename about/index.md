description: More than you could possibly want to know about Martin Steel
---

Hiya, I’m Martin Steel. I'm a Software Developer and Systems Administrator and I've lived in Manchester, UK, since moving here for university back in late 2000.

Depending upon when you're reading this, I'm either about to start, or currently working, as an ICT Engineer at [Halley research station](https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/) in Antarctica.

From a professional point of view I’ve been a .NET Developer and System Administrator for just over 13 years. Fist for 11 and a bit years at [Mediaburst](https://www.mediaburst.co.uk) where I spent my day writing [Clockwork](https://www.clockworksms.com) and [Textburst](https://www.textburst.com), babysitting servers, occasionally swearing at Cisco and HP networking kit and panicing when things broke. And then for a little under a year at Footasylum where I worked on internal tools.

Outside of work, I [quit my job](/blog/2016/ive-quit-my-job/) back in March 2016, bought a load of hiking stuff, and spent 6.5 months hiking [all 2,189 miles](/blog/2016/i-finished-the-at/) of the Appalachian Trail.
