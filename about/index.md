description: More than you could possibly want to know about Martin Steel
---

Hiya, Iâ€™m Martin Steel and I'm currently working at Halley Research Station in Antarctica as an ICT Engineer. 

Previously I spent 11 and a bit years working at [Mediaburst](https://www.mediaburst.co.uk) as a .NET Developer and Systems/Network Engineer where I spent my day writing [Clockwork](https://www.clockworksms.com) and [Textburst](https://www.textburst.com), babysitting servers, occasionally swearing at Cisco and HP networking kit and panicking when things broke.

I then [quit my job](/blog/2016/ive-quit-my-job), bought a load of hiking stuff, headed off to America and hiked the full 2,190 mile length of the Appalachian Trail.

And finally I spent 9 months working at Footasylum as a Software Engineer before quitting to come to Antarctica.
