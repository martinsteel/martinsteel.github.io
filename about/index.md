Hiya, I'm Martin Steel and I live and work in Manchester's Northern Quarter, that’s in the UK for those of you who reading from distant shores. I’ve lived around here since I started my degree at UMIST in late 2000, and so far I haven't found any reason to leave.

I'm a .NET developer and System Administrator at [Mediaburst](https://www.mediaburst.co.uk) where I spend my day writing [Clockwork](https://www.clockworksms.com) and [Textburst](https://www.textburst.com), babysitting servers, occasionally swearing at Cisco and HP networking kit and panicing when things break.

When I’m not at work I tend to be doing geeky things like setting up this blog.
