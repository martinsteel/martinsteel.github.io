description: More than you could possibly want to know about Martin Steel
---

Hiya, I’m Martin Steel and up until recently I lived and worked in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, that’s in the UK for those of you reading from distant shores. I’ve lived around Manchester since I started my degree at UMIST in late 2000, and have only just found a reason to leave.

From a professional point of view I’m a .NET Developer and System Administrator, and for 11 and a bit years up to March 2016 I worked at [Mediaburst](https://www.mediaburst.co.uk) where I spent my day writing [Clockwork](https://www.clockworksms.com) and [Textburst](https://www.textburst.com), babysitting servers, occasionally swearing at Cisco and HP networking kit and panicing when things broke.

Since then I’ve [quit my job](/blog/2016/ive-quit-my-job), bought a load of hiking stuff, headed off to America and hiked the full 2,190 mile length of the Appalachian Trail.
